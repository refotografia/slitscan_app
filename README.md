<h5>This is one of 3 apps that I have created recently. I have been investigating in<br>
programming for so long, but never really got into doing it. Life took its turns, <br>
and I was presented with a chance to explore deeper into it and refresh some couple<br>
decades old knowlodge on image processing.</h5>
<h5>Started from an app by Mark Jarzynski.<br>
Rewrote to use PyQT5 and Imageio v3.<br>
Created presets for specific cases I felt IÂ´d use the most.</h5>
